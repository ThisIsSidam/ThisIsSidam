- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ThisIsSidam
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in app and game development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and thinking to learn kotlin or java next.
- ðŸ“« You can whatsapp me on +917281070478 or email me on thisissidam@gmail.com. I go by Thisissidam on all social media apps. Although I don't use many. Reddit is favourite and I've just started LinkedIn.

- I am a teenager, wanting to be a writer, programmer and a voice actor, but doesn't actually have a computer or a mic. Currently, I have
installed VNC viewer, Andronix and Termux on my smartphone, with which I have a linux to learn my programming on. Thank you for reading.
